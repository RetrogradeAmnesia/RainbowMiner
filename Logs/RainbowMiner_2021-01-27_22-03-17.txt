*** RainbowMiner Configuration ***


Hints (read them all! It will make entering data much easier):

- press Return to accept the defaults
- fields marked with * are mandatory
- use comma "," to separate list entries
- add new entries to a list, by adding a "+" in front of your input
- remove entries from a list, by adding a "-" in front of your input
- enter "list" or "help" to show a list of all valid entries
- enter "back" or "<" to repeat the last input
- enter "delete" to clear a non-mandatory entry
- enter "save" or "done" to end config and save changes
- enter "exit" or "cancel" to abort without any changes to the configuration


(1) Basic Setup


Every pool (except the MiningPoolHub) wants the miner to send a worker's name. You can change the name later. Please enter only letters and numbers.


Let's start with the local setup of this machine's API.

RainbowMiner can be monitored using your webbrowser via API:
- on this machine: http://localhost:4000
- on most devices in the network: http://DESKTOP-KG848PC:4000
- on any other device in the network: http://192.168.8.101:4000


Please lookup your BTC wallet address. It is easy: copy it to your clipboard and then press the right mouse key in this window to paste


If you plan to mine on Nicehash, you need to register an account with them, to get a NiceHash mining wallet address (please read the Pools section of our readme!).
If you do not want to use Nicehash as a pool, leave this empty (or enter "clear" to make it empty) and press return
